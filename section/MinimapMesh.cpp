//Adding ability to disable mesh renderer for minimap
//if DefaultMiniLOD = 0 (there is a console command for it) then Moho::Cartographic::RenderMeshes function call will be skipped
//this allows to skip an enormous amount of useless computations, as minimap works similar to main camera
//and as it's mainly zoomed out, there are thousands of objects that are always in view
//and this in turn causes mesh renderer to do thousands of useless LOD calculations per frame
